Track and plan our project notes

If your team wants to be making good progress you should have code working already that
	- reads command line arguments to determine what mode to run in, what trace file to read, and whether to enable your debugging statements (optional)
	- reads/parses a trace file
	- if debugging turned on, outputs what you’ve just parsed to ensure it’s working
	- maybe keeps a running count of the number of reads and writes and prints that out in a (partial) summary (rest to be completed when you’ve got a cache)

and your team should be thinking about and maybe writing down
	- outline of a test plan
	- sketch of data structures needed to represent the cache
